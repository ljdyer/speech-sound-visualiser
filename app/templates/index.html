        <h1>Speech Sound Visualiser</h1>
        <p>Created by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ljdyer">Laurence Dyer</a> as part of a University
            assignment on automatic speech recognition in December 2021.</p>
        <p>Click the Begin button and then follow the instructions on the next page to record yourself saying something
            and see visualisations of the raw waveform, spectrum, and regular and mel spectrograms.</p>
        <p>Before you start, make sure you have a microphone installed and ready to use. The browser may prompt you for
            permission to record the first time you use the site: be sure to grant it.</p>
        <p class="red-text">Note: Once you go to the next page, please do not refresh, as it will cause errors when recording.</p>
